CS1302 Homework 3

Java program that calls a method called removeZeroes that takes as a parameter an ArrayList of integers and eliminates any occurrences of the number 0 from the list. For example, if the list stores the values [0,4,5,0,6,0,1] before the method is called, it should store the values [4,5,6,1] after the method finishes executing. 

Given a CalendarDate class below, complete the class to include a constructor, accessors, mutators, toString method and a compareTo method. Years take precedence over months, which take precedence over days. For example, August 21, 2011 comes before March 3, 2018.

Client class that creates an ArrayList with at least 5 objects of the CalendarDate class. Print the ArrayList, then sort the ArrayList and print it again.
